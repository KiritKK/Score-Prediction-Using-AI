# Score-Prediction-Using-AI
Using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to train a model to recognize a pattern or trend in the scores of cricket teams

We will be using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to train a model to recognize a pattern or trend in the scores of teams, for all their matches. We will be using T20, ODI and IPL data (three forms of Cricket matches) to train the model. 

Once the initial dataset is fed into the model, we will plot regression plots using this data, to try and see if there is a trend in the scores of matches, and whether it can be extended to predict future matches. In regards to this, we will check the accuracy of the prediction with an actual score to test the validity of our model.
